                    Multi-threaded PMC Test program

This program is intended for optimizing a little piece of code written in 
C++ or assembly.

The code to test will be executed a fixed number of times and the 
test results will be output for each repetition. This program measures 
how many clock cycles the code to test takes in each repetition. 
Furthermore, it is possible to set a number of Performance Monitor Counters
(PMC) to count the number of micro-operations (uops), cache misses, 
branch mispredictions, etc.
It is possible to run the same code in multiple threads simultaneously in
order to test resource contention between threads.

The setup of the Performance Monitor Counters is microprocessor-specific.
The specifications for possible performance monitor counters for each 
microprocessor family is defined in the table CounterDefinitions in the 
bottom of the file PMCTestA.cpp. It is possible to make additions to this
table.

System requirements:
--------------------
Windows 2000 or later, or Linux, 32 or 64 bit.
Microsoft, Gnu or Intel C++ compiler.
MASM, YASM, NASM or JWasm assembler.


Instructions:
-------------
PMCTest uses a kernel mode driver for getting access to the performance
monitor counters (PMCs). There are three versions of the driver:
* MSRDriver32.sys is used in 32-bit Windows systems.
* MSRDriver64.sys is used in 64-bit Windows systems, even if the test 
  program runs in 32 bit mode.
* MSRdrv is used in Linux systems, both 32 and 64 bit.

The test program consists of two modules, A and B. The A module, written
in C++ (PMCTestA.cpp), contains interface to the driver, thread creation,
locking each thread to a specific CPU core, a table of PMC defitions for
different microprocessors, and output of the results. All OS-dependent
functions are in the files PMCTestWin.h and PMCTestLinux.h, which are
included conditionally from PMCTestA.cpp.

The B module is where you put in the piece of code to test. The test code
is repeated in a loop that reads the counters before and after each 
execution of the test code. A dummy loop without the test code measures
the overhead counts for reading the counters and looping. This overhead
is subtracted from the test counts. The B module must be compiled or
assembled after each modification of the test code. There are several
versions of the B module:
PMCTestB.cpp     C++ language, 32 and 64 bit mode, Windows and Linux
PMCTestB32.asm   Assembly language, MASM syntax, 32 bit Windows
PMCTestB64.asm   Assembly language, MASM syntax, 64 bit Windows
PMCTestB32.nasm  Assembly language, NASM/YASM syntax, 32 bit Linux or Windows
PMCTestB64.nasm  Assembly language, NASM/YASM syntax, 64 bit Linux or Windows

You need only one of the B files. The B file must be compiled or assembled
and linked together with the compiled A file into an executable file.

Insert the piece of code you want to test in the B file at the place indicated 
"Test code start". Alternatively, you may put the test code into a separate 
third module and call it from the B module.

Find the list of possible performance monitor counters at the bottom of PMCTestA.cpp.
Find the counters you want to use and insert the counter id numbers in the 
B file in the table named "CounterTypesDesired". The maximum number of counters
you can have depends on the microprocessor.

Compile for console mode, 32 or 64 bits. Make sure unicode is not enabled.

If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 you can open one of the following
project files:
A32.vcxproj:  Assembly language, 32-bit mode
A64.vcxproj:  Assembly language, 64-bit mode
C32.vcxproj:  C++ language, 32-bit mode
C64.vcxproj:  C++ language, 64-bit mode
Similar project files are available for Visual Studio 2008.


If you are using any other compiler IDE then make a project containing 
PMCTestA.cpp and one of the B files. Turn off unicode support. You may
need to define a custom build step for the assembly file, e.g.
Command line: ml64 /c /Zi /Fl $(InputFileName)
Output: $(InputName).obj

You may build the test program without an IDE. The following batch or script
files are provided for convenience:
a32.sh  Linux, 32 bit mode, YASM assembler
a64.sh  Linux, 64 bit mode, YASM assembler
m32.bat  Windows, 32 bit mode, MASM assembler
m64.bat  Windows, 64 bit mode, MASM assembler
n32.bat  Windows, 32 bit mode, NASM assembler
n64.bat  Windows, 64 bit mode, NASM assembler
y32.bat  Windows, 32 bit mode, YASM assembler
y64.bat  Windows, 64 bit mode, YASM assembler
In Windows, you need to modify the bat files to insert the correct paths for the 
compiler, linker, assembler, library files and header files. These paths depend on 
the compiler version installed.
In Linux, you need to make the script files executable by:
chmod 744 *.sh
Then execute with e.g.  ./go32.sh


Installing the driver in Windows:
---------------------------------
The driver files MSRDriver32.sys and MSRDriver64.sys must be available in the same 
directory as the test program. The driver is installed the first time the test
program runs. If you want to uninstall the driver use uninstall.exe

Note: If running under 64 bits Windows Vista or Windows 7 or later, then you have 
to press F8 during system boot and select "Disable Driver Signature Enforcement". 

The compiled program must be run with administrator rights.
If running from Visual Studio or any other IDE then run the IDE as administrator.
If running from a .bat file then run the .bat file or the command prompt as administrator.

The driver is not needed if you set USE_PERFORMANCE_COUNTERS to 0 in the B file.


Installing the driver in Linux:
-------------------------------
Unpack DriverSrcLinux.zip into an empty folder. Then:
make
chmod 744 install.sh
sudo ./install.sh

See DriverSrcLinux.txt for details. You need to reinstall after reboot.


Multithreading:
---------------
Some microprocessors have multiple cores and some processors can run two threads 
in each core. The total number of threads that the processor can run simultaneously is 
the number of cores times the number of threads per core. The maximum number of threads
to run during the test is limited to 4 or 8 by MAXTHREADS in the file PMCTest.h. 
You can run multiple threads in order to test the influence of multithreading on performance.
If you run 3 threads on a processor with multiple cores and two threads per core then
you will have two threads (proc. 0 and 1) in the first core and one thread (proc. 2) in
the second core. The first two theads are likely to run slower because they are sharing
the same resources. Make sure the threads do not write to the same cache lines.

You should use the multithreading feature only when you want to test resource contention
between threads. The results may be misleading or difficult to interpret.
The most consistent and reliable results are obtained by running only a single thread.


Microprocessors supported:
--------------------------
* Intel microprocessors from Pentium 1 through Pentium 4, Pentium M, 
  Core Solo/Duo, Core 2, Nehalem, Sandy Bridge, Atom.
* AMD Duron, Athlon, Athlon 64, Opteron, K8, K10, Bobcat, Bulldozer.
* VIA Nano (The PMCs in VIA Nano are undocumented).

These microprocessors all have time stamp counters and performance monitor
counters. The performance monitor counters are microprocessor specific. The
PMC programs may need modification to work with future microprocessor families.


User options:
-------------

The following options can be set by modifying the B file:

REPETITIONS:     The number of times the test code is repeated. The output will show
                 the results for each repetition.

NUM_THREADS:     Number of simultaneous threads. Set to 1 unless you are testing 
                 multithreading performance.

USE_PERFORMANCE_COUNTERS: Set to 1 if you are using performance monitor counters.

SUBTRACT_OVERHEAD: Set to 1 to subtract program overhead from clock counts and
                 performance counts. You may set this to 0 if the overhead counts
                 are unstable because of multithreading.

OVERHEAD_REPETITIONS: Number of repetitions to measure the program overhead. This
                 should be more than 1 in order to eliminate cache effects.

CACHELINESIZE:   The size, in bytes, of cache lines in the microprocessor. This value
                 is needed in case of multithreading in order to prevent threads from
                 using the same cache lines.

CounterTypesDesired: Counter id numbers for the counter types you want to use, e.g.
                 id 100 for counting micro-operations. The id numbers are CPU-specific.
                 These are listed in the table CounterDefinitions in PMCTestA.cpp.

User data:       Any static data that your test code may need.

User Initializations: Any initializations that your test code may need before the test loop.

Test code start: Insert the code to test here.


Defining new event counters:
----------------------------
You can add new counter types in the table CounterDefinitions in PMCTestA.cpp according 
to the manual for the CPU in question. The fields in the table are:
id:       An arbitrary id number.
scheme:   The counter scheme defines whitch model-specific registers to use. This is
          specific for a particular brand and family of CPUs. Values may be OR'ed if
          multiple sub-schemes have the same counters.
cpu:      The CPU type for whitch the counter works. Values may be OR'ed.
CounterFirst, CounterLast: The range of counter registers that can be used.
eventreg: Event register, if applicable.
event:    Identification of the event to count.
mask:     Bit-mask possibly identifying sub-events.
name:     A name to show on the output listing. Max. 9 characters.


Defining new CPUs:
------------------
The function CCounters::GetProcessorVendor() identifies the CPU vendor.
The function CCounters::GetProcessorFamily() identifies the CPU family and model.
The function CCounters::GetPMCScheme() finds the appropriate PMC scheme for the 
specific CPU vendor, family and model.
The function CCounters::DefineCounter(SCounterDefinition & CDef) specifies how to
set up the necessary model-specific registers for a particular PMC scheme. 
You may get a blue screen error if you attempt to use a model-specific register that
doesn't exist in the current CPU.


Troubleshooting:
----------------
Cannot load driver:
    Make sure the *.sys driver files are available in the path.
    The 64 bit driver MSRDriver64.sys is needed under x64 Windows, even if
    running in 32 bit mode.
    If running under Windows Vista or Windows 7: Press F8 during system boot
    and select "Disable Driver Signature Enforcement". 
    Run as administrator.
    Ignore the popup message "Windows requires a digitally signed driver".

Error compiling *.cpp file:
    Make sure the character set is ASCII, not unicode. In Visual C++ set
    Project -> Properties -> General -> Character set -> Not Set.
    Make sure you compile for console mode, unmanaged code.
    Do not enable precompiled headers. Comment out "#include <intrin.h>" in 
    the .cpp files if the compiler doesn't support intrinsics.

Unresolved externals:
    Make sure you define a custom build rule for any .asm file if you are
    using MS Visual Studio:
    For PMCTestB32.asm: Right click on PMCTestB32.asm -> Properties ->
    All Configurations -> Custom Build Step -> Command Line:
    ml /c /Cx /Zi /Fl $(InputFileName)
    Outputs: $(InputName).obj
    For PMCTestB64.asm: Same as above. Use ml64 instead of ml.

Cannot make counter:
    The numbers in CounterTypesDesired in the B file should fit the CPU type
    you are running on. Available numbers are listed in PMCTestA.cpp under
    CounterDefinitions.
